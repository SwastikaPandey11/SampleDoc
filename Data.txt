🎙️ Tech Friday Podcast Script

Host (You):
“Hello everyone, and welcome to another exciting episode of Tech Friday!
Everywhere we look today, there’s GenAI — writing emails, summarizing reports, even powering chatbots in banking. But if GenAI is today’s buzz, the real question is: what’s next? What else is shaping the financial world in 2025, and what will define the future of banking beyond GenAI?

To explore these top trends in finance for 2025, we have with us Vinay Pandey, a seasoned Principal Engineer who is leading the Liquidity team and has done wonders for the organization with his innovative thinking and leadership.

Vinay, welcome to the show!”

Q1 – Why these trends now?

Host:
“Let’s start at the very beginning. Why are these trends even emerging in the first place? What’s driving the need for them in finance today?”

➡️ (Vinay explains about AI imperatives & risks, new frontiers of computing, and human–machine synergy.)


---

Q2 – Shift to Agentic AI

Host:
“That brings us to the first trend itself. GenAI has already become mainstream — but now we’re hearing about a shift to Agentic AI. Why is this gaining so much traction in banking, and how exactly is it changing the way financial institutions operate?”

➡️ (Vinay explains Agentic AI, real-world use cases in banks, and the ‘agency gap’ between human agents and agentic AI.)


---

Q3 – AI Governance

Host:
“And as you said, this ‘agency gap’ opens up some big challenges. Which naturally brings us to governance. With AI systems making more autonomous decisions, how do you see AI governance coming into the picture, and why is it such a hot topic in 2025?”

➡️ (Vinay talks about governance frameworks, compliance, regulation, and responsible AI in banking.)


---

Q4 – Disinformation Security

Host:
“Governance also ties into another issue — information integrity. With AI generating content at scale, both good and bad, how do we deal with the spread of disinformation? In finance especially, how do we know what can be trusted?”

➡️ (Vinay explains disinformation security, risks for markets and trust, and how banks are responding.)


---

Q5 – Post-Quantum Cryptography

Host:
“Shifting gears a bit — let’s look ahead to the new frontiers of computing. Quantum computing is no longer just research, it’s a real threat and opportunity. What’s your take on post-quantum cryptography, and why should banks care about it now?”

➡️ (Vinay explains how quantum could break today’s encryption and how banks are preparing.)


---

Q6 – Hybrid Computing

Host:
“And as we prepare for a quantum future, we keep hearing about hybrid computing — mixing classical with quantum, or cloud with edge. Why is hybrid computing trending, and what role do you see it playing in finance?”

➡️ (Vinay explains hybrid approaches and early experiments in banks.)


---

Q7 – Real-world Use Cases in New Frontiers

Host:
“So if we combine all these ideas — quantum, hybrid, smarter architectures — what are some real-world use cases? Where do you see the most exciting applications emerging?”

➡️ (Vinay talks about ambient invisible intelligence, background intelligence improving fraud detection, liquidity risk management, etc.)


---

Q8 – Polyfunctional Robots

Host:
“Now moving into human–machine synergy. Robots in finance used to mean ATMs, but we’re now talking about polyfunctional robots that can handle multiple tasks. Why are they trending in 2025, and how might banks actually use them?”

➡️ (Vinay explains examples of polyfunctional robots in operations, customer service, branch automation, etc.)


---

Q9 – Neurological Enhancement

Host:
“And finally, something that almost feels like science fiction — neurological enhancement. Why is this even part of the finance conversation, and what kind of early use cases or possibilities are you seeing?”

➡️ (Vinay explains neurological enhancement, decision augmentation, cognitive assistance for financial professionals.)


---

🎙️ Closing

Host:
“Vinay, this has been such an eye-opening conversation. From the rise of Agentic AI and the challenges of governance, to the futuristic frontiers of quantum, hybrid computing, and even human–machine synergy — it’s clear that finance in 2025 is about so much more than just money. It’s about reimagining the very foundations of trust, intelligence, and human potential.

Thank you so much for joining us today, and to all our listeners — thank you for tuning in to Tech Friday. Stay curious, stay future-ready, and we’ll see you in the next episode!”
