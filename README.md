Absolutely. Here's an elaborated version of the POC section, with problem statements, objectives, technologies used, and strategic importance—suitable for including in your mid-year review or presentation.

Proof of Concepts (POCs)

1. SharePoint-Based Patent Site

Problem Statement: Previously, the patent site was hosted on FoundationIP, a third-party tool that required external access and had licensing constraints. This posed challenges in terms of data privacy, internal collaboration, and dependency on vendor tools. The need was to bring the patent management system in-house, making it more secure, cost-effective, and aligned with organizational IT policies.

Solution: To address this, I initiated a POC to rebuild the patent site using SharePoint as the backend for internal hosting. The new system leverages SharePoint's built-in authentication, role-based access controls, and document management features to ensure tighter data security and easier integration with other internal systems.

Approach & Technology Stack:

Frontend: Developed using WFRIA (React framework) for dynamic and responsive UI.

Backend: Leveraged SharePoint for hosting, content management, and permission control.

Enabled role-based access, ensuring that only authorized users can view or manage sensitive patent information.

Designed the system to be scalable and easily extensible for additional IP-related modules in the future.


Impact & Importance:

Reduced external dependency and recurring licensing costs associated with FoundationIP.

Improved data security by keeping all patent-related documentation within the enterprise firewall.

Enabled better collaboration and internal ownership of intellectual property management processes.

Laid the foundation for migrating other legacy legal systems to internal platforms.

2. CSV Upload and Column Selection Application

Problem Statement: Users across multiple teams needed a simple, intuitive tool to upload CSV data and view selected columns interactively, especially for ad-hoc data analysis and operational use-cases. There was no lightweight internal tool available for this, leading teams to rely on Excel or third-party tools, which lacked flexibility and version control.

Solution: Developed a lightweight internal application that allows users to:

Upload CSV files.

Select specific columns of interest.

View the filtered data in a tabular format within the application.


Approach & Technology Stack:

Frontend: Built using Material UI for a clean, modern, and responsive user experience.

Backend: Implemented using Spring Boot, providing REST APIs for CSV processing and data serving.

Database: Used MongoDB to store metadata like selected columns and upload logs.

Added features to validate file format, display errors gracefully, and provide a download option for filtered data.


Impact & Importance:

Provides a quick, reusable utility for internal data handling tasks.

Significantly reduces reliance on manual Excel operations, enabling smart and secure data workflows.

Can be integrated into broader data platforms or enhanced to support more file formats and transformations.

Demonstrates how small tools can have a high operational impact when tailored for user needs.
